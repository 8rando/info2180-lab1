    <h2>Brandon Bradshaw</h2>
    <p>My name is Brandon Bradshaw. I mean I told you this already but some of my 
        favourite hobbies are  playing video games, reading and playing basketball. Jimmy Butler is my favorite player,
         and the Miami Heat is my favorite team. One thing I hope to gain from this course is the ability to use Github 
         among many other platforms more effectively and in turn be more open minded to try out 
        new technologies as I advance in my career in this field. </p>
