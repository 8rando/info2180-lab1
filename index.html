    <h2>Brandon Bradshaw</h2>
    <p>My name is Brandon Bradshaw. I mean I told you this already but some of my 
        favourite hobbies are  playing video games, reading and playing basketball. Jimmy Butler is my favorite player,
         and the Miami Heat is my favorite team. One thing I hope to gain from this web development
          course is to be more open minded to technology
         used to make websites more visually appealing as it is also my first 
         time delving deep into web development and its tools.
          However, I am thankful that the university has this course. </p>
